# ArchX Roadmap

Our mission is to build the most intelligent, adaptive acceleration engine for the Rust ecosystem.

## v3.0 (Current - Sovereign Performance)
- [x] **Core Engine Architecture**: Modular, layered hardware abstraction.
- [x] **Sovereign Fluent API**: Unified, chainable interface for CPU/GPU/Hybrid.
- [x] **Unified Scheduler**: Adaptive workload splitting with resource awareness.
- [x] **Safe Math Primitives**: Deeply integrated arithmetic safety modes.
- [x] **Global Hardware Registry**: Dynamic SIMD and GPU vendor discovery.

## v3.1 - The Resilience Update
- [ ] **Thermal Polling**: Dynamic throttling based on core temperatures.
- [ ] **Power Management**: Battery-aware execution modes for mobile workstations.
- [ ] **Memory Protection**: Enhanced heap limits and guard rails for multi-gigabyte datasets.

## v4.0 - The Neural Horizon
- [ ] **ML Integration**: Built-in support for simple tensor operations and neutral net kernels.
- [ ] **Remote Compute**: Zero-config distributed execution across ArchX nodes.
- [ ] **Visual Profiler**: Real-time dashboard for hardware utilization and strategy metrics.

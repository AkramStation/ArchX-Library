# ArchX Roadmap

Our mission is to build the most intelligent, adaptive acceleration engine for the Rust ecosystem.

## v1.2 (Current)
- [x] Fluent Builder API (`ArchXEngine`).
- [x] Professional Diagnostics & Human-Readable Profiling.
- [x] Major Ecosystem Branding & Documentation.

## v1.3 - The Extension Era
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow users to register custom optimizer paths for domain-specific math.
- [ ] **ARM Parity**: First-class support for ARM Neon (Apple Silicon / Raspberry Pi).
- [ ] **Dynamic Throttling**: Automatically reduce thread count if system temperature or battery level is critical.

## v1.4 - Distributed Compute
- [ ] **Network Offload**: Experimental support for offloading compute to remote ArchX nodes.
- [ ] **Visual Profiler**: A web-based dashboard for real-time visualization of engine decisions.
